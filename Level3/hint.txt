	Password for this level is an element of the multiplicative
	group Z_p^* where p = 19807040628566084398385987581 is a prime. 
	You carefully look around and find three pairs of numbers of the
	form (a, password * g^a) where g is a element in Z_p^* and a is 
	an integer. The g in each pair is the same.
